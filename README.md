To use cmake follow below steps:
1. make build dir in root directory. 
2. Run, cd build
3. Run, cmake .. 
The above command will generate Makefile and other files in build directory.
4. Simply run make in build directory.
5. To install boost library use following command.

Ubuntu: "sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev"
Visual studio Windows : Install the package using package manager console using command "NuGet\Install-Package boost_system-vc142 -Version 1.71.0"

Note: CMake supports out-of-source build. Even the most simple project should never mix-up
sources with generated files. In-source build is a BAD choice.
